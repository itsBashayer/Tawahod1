**Communication Card App for Children with Autism** is an innovative tool designed to help children express their feelings and needs in an easy and effective way. This app allows children to use talking cards to empower them to communicate better with others, enhancing their ability to express themselves in various situations. Whether at home or school, the app makes it easy for children to connect with parents, teachers, and peers.

I have a brother with autism, and it is very difficult for us to understand him and his needs. He struggles to explain what he wants, which saddens me greatly. In autism centers, children rely on a very basic method using printed pictures, pointing to what they need. As a sister of a child with autism and given my technical background, I thought, why not use modern technology to turn these paper cards into talking cards? This way, we can use technology in a beneficial way for them.
